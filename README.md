*Description*
The Bank Account Manager is a console-based Java application that enables users to manage multiple customer bank accounts. The application allows users to create new accounts, deposit funds, withdraw money, and check the balance of individual accounts. It supports both savings and current account types, with interest calculations applied automatically based on the account type.

This project demonstrates fundamental concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP) in Java, including classes, objects, and methods, and provides a practical example of how to handle user input and manage data in a structured way.

*Features*
Add Account: Create new customer accounts with a name, account number, and account type (savings or current).
Deposit Funds: Deposit money into a selected account.
Withdraw Funds: Withdraw money from a selected account with balance checks to prevent overdrawing.
Check Balance: Display the current balance of a selected account.
Interest Calculation: Automatically apply interest to savings and current accounts during deposit operations.
